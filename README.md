# Planival

This is my graduation project from the Web Development-Bootcamp at [neuefische](https://neuefische.de/weiterbildung/web-development-hamburg) in Hamburg.

Planival has been developed to facilitate the planning of several (music) festivals with different festival crews. Users can create their individual user profile to tell a little bit about themselves. The core feature is the creation of a festival planner. Users can invite their friends to create and edit a communal todo-list and update their Festival-Playlist via Spotify.

*Note: This mobile desktop app is optimized for the option iPhone 6/7/8 in your web browser.
Currently, no permanent storage of user data can be guaranteed.*
